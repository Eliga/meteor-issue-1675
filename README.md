Meteor [Issue 1675](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/issues/1675) : "lib order"


Documentation says : 
>Files in the lib directory at the root of your application are loaded first.

but if you organize your app with modules directory structure, you get :

> app/lib/some_code.js

loaded AFTER :

> app/module/lib/some_other_code.js

It seems it's rather : 
> Files in the deepest directory, with a lib part,  are loaded first.


Example runs here:
